            <h3>Reasons for taking a class in programming</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Understanding computers and learning the basics of coding will help me develop an appreciation of how things work. It will also teaches me how software engineers use math in order to solve problems in a logical and creative way.</p></li>
                <li><p>Learning to code will teach me how to think. Computer programming isnâ€™t just about teaching how to type lines of code. It is more about learning how to think differently. Being able to code effectively, a programmer needs to use logical thinking. I will need to be able to see a large problem and break it down into smaller pieces in order to solve it in an effective manner.</p></li>
                <li><p>Coding is important to learn because computer programming teaches us to experiment and gives them the confidence to be creative. </p></li>
                <li><p>When you look at how the world is developing, coding is an extremely useful skill to possess. There are an increasing number of businesses who rely on computer code, not just those in the technology sector. Learning how to code will have the advantage in life with more employment opportunities available in the future, whether it be in the technology sector, finance, retail, health or other.</p></li>
